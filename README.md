# Marble Marcher for Linux

This is a fork of [Marble Marcher](https://github.com/HackerPoet/MarbleMarcher) with precomipled libraries and a binary in order to easily run on Linux. Click [here](https://github.com/yellowcrash10/MarbleMarcher-Linux/archive/master.zip) (or clone this repository) to download it. Just unzip it and execute start.sh. Alternatively, you can install the [Lutris](https://lutris.net) game manager, go to [this page](https://lutris.net/games/marble-marcher/), click "show unpublished installers", and click install next to "Update 5 version" to download the game automatically and run it from a nice interface.

This was tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and Solus.

## Original Description
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jgoldfar/MarbleMarcher.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jgoldfar/MarbleMarcher)

Marble Marcher is a video game demo that uses a fractal physics engine and fully procedural rendering to produce beautiful and unique gameplay unlike anything you've seen before.

The goal of the game is to reach the flag as quickly as possible.  But be careful not to
fall off the level or get crushed by the fractal!  There are 24 levels to unlock.

## System Dependencies
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
* [SFML 2.5.0](https://www.sfml-dev.org)
### MacOS
On macOS these can be conveniently installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

`brew install eigen sfml`

(Note that SFML might require a newer version than the one from Homebrew, in which case a manual installation is required)

Alternatively, [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) can be used:

`vcpkg install eigen3 sfml`
### Arch Linux
`sudo pacman -S eigen sfml git cmake make`



## Building
### MacOS
* `mkdir build && cd build`
* `cmake ..`
    * If you use `vcpkg`, add the flag `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path/to/vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`
* `cd ..`
* `cmake --build build`

Alternatively, one can use the platform-dependent build system, for example `Make`:

* `make -C build`
### Arch Linux
* `cd ~`
* `git clone https://github.com/HackerPoet/MarbleMarcher.git`
* `cd MarbleMarcher`
* `mkdir build && cd build`
* `cmake ..`
* `cd ..`
* `cmake --build build`
* `cp build/MarbleMarcher ./`


## Launching
* Make sure that the current working directory contains the `assets` folder
* Run the executable generated by CMake, located in `build` (or a subdirectory)
* If running MarbleMarcher from a tarball and you see a message like

> ./MarbleMarcher: error while loading shared libraries: libsfml-graphics.so.2.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

You'll just need to run MarbleMarcher with the correct `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:

```shell
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/usr/lib ./MarbleMarcher
```
